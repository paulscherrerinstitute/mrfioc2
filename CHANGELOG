	- Compiles under Windows system (tested on: GNU Make 4.1, Linker Version 12.00.21005.1, Compiler Version 18.00.21005.1 for x64)
	- Resolved a bug in SFP code, where uninitialized 'timer' could cause segmentation fault
	- Data buffer fixes: 
		- changed the way data buffer instance is fetched internally
		- SW overflow is detected only for segments someone is interested in (we don't care for the rest)
		- in order to avoid copying entire data buffer in 300 series, maximum length to copy is derived from segments all users are interested in. This will be further fixed with new HW fixes for the data buffer.
		- user update thread priority can be set by the user
    	- dataBufferUser class now directly exposes underlying Rx and Tx buffer. Prefered way of interfacing with the data buffer are still send() and get() functions.
    	- added userOffset, which enables the user to select where 0 offset will be in respect to the start of the data buffer
    	- minor bug fixes
