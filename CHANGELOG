2.7.24 : Fri 3 Mar 2017:
	- Beam OK mechanism updated

2.7.23 : Thu 5 Jan 2017:
	- EVR sequencer support added (starting from firmware version 0x207, or its development version counterpart - 0x206)
	- EVG health monitoring bug fix, where removing SFPs would show incorrect overall status
	- EVR iocsh memory read and write function names updated (mrmEvrRead, mrmEvrWrite)
	- PSI specific: added template (loaded by default) which indicates if machine beam is currently OK or not.
	- PSI specific: removed build-time dependancy on pev driver for eldk52-e500v2 arhitecture. 'pev' driver is no longer loaded by default on IOC startup

2.7.22 : Fri 25 Nov 2016:
	- EVR fine delay module: bug fixed, where setting one delay output would reset the other
	- EVR: added a template and GUI which can be used to see event pattern received on the EVR (evr-eventPatternCheck.template)

2.7.21 : Thu 27 Okt 2016:
	- PSI: updated names of links pointing to master timing

2.7.20 : Tue 25 Okt 2016:

2.7.19 : Okt 2016:
	- EVR health template calculations updated
	- GUIs updated (for EVRs).

2.7.18 : Tue 30 Avg 2016:
	- EVR: Hard coded delay compensation target value and source record for SwissFEL. This is not a proper solution and must be fixed soon

2.7.15 : Mon 4 Jul 2016:
	- added basic screen for EVRs (pulsers and outputs control) together with new start_EVR-simple.sh script. Pulsers and outputs now have a record for description (*-Name-I). Warning! Outputs had a simmilar record, which is now removed!
	- EVR: added iocsh functions mrmEvrMrmRead and mrmEvrMrmWrite for direct access to the memory area

2.7.13 : Wed 20 Apr 2016:
	- EVR health monitoring update
	- sourcing target delay compensation for EVRs can now be disabled from the substitution file
	- bug fix, where pulser gates were not set correctly (due to change in device support handling)

2.7.12 : Tue 19 Apr 2016:
	- EVG-300 series now supports more output sources (with some improved error handling). Because of more output sources, the database changed comparing to 230 series.
	- substitution file updates: 
	  - descriptions, 
	  - new macros for 300 series, 
	  - new default values for event clock and EVR target delay compensation
	  - CMLs are now configured to respond as normal outputs by default
	- Pulser divisor, prescaler delay and width records now support 32-bit values
	- Fixed bug where some macro setting was not applied (eg. PSX-Div-SP)
	- added GUIs and databases for PCIe-300DC
	- EVR pulsers now have software set/reset exposed
	- driver version added to GUI
	- documentation update (for 300-series)
	- Fixed a bug in device support, where SEVR what not 0 uppon init (bug affected mbboDirect records).
	- EVG-300 can have link violations on all ports reset at the same time (also remotely)
	- EVRs can update their target delay compensation value from a remote record
	- GUI script: -n option added, which does not attach to existing caQtDM but opens new one instead

2.7.11 : Fri 18 Mar 2016:
	- EVG health monitoring updated (link error obeys MON_PORTS macro)
	- bug fix: typo in macro name (in example substitution file) for evr-configTriggerSwitch.template
	- bug fix: incorrect link in evgMxc.template

2.7.10 : Tue 15 Mar 2016:
	- added evr-configTriggerSwitch.template for easy configuration of trigger switching (pulser set up + gating)
	- updated sfp.template alarm settings (based on AV02-0447EN and AV02-0881EN datasheets)
	- exposed data buffer properties to records/GUI for EVRs, and added iocsh function mrmDataBufferReport

2.7.9 : Wed 24 Feb 2016:
    - added example substitution files (EVG-VME-300 used as fanout, EVR-PCIe-300DC )
    - EVG: Setting a MXC frequency no longer resets all MXC counters. A button to explicitly reset all counters was added to the GUI.
    - EVG: Health monitor template added to 300-series substitution files
    - Bux fix: dbior command would not print report for all loaded devices

2.7.8 : Fri 12 Feb 2016:
	- Added health monitor template for EVM-VME-300 series.
	- Added support for EVR-PCIe-300DC series cards: added device IDs, updated interrupt handling and added N25Q flash chip support
	- updated GUIs in order to remove more display bugs that became apparent when using caQtDm version 4.0.2

2.7.7 : Fri 29 Jan 2016 17:30 CET:
	- Added option to ignore version errors while initializing the driver. This option also disables enabling and connecting interrupts on PCI devices.
	- Name of iocsh functions for flashing changed. Record in flash.template changed name from *IsSupported-RB to *IsOffsetValid-RB. Added iocsh function to set offset (address where reading/writing from/to the flash chip starts)
	- Event clock can now be set to as low as 45 MHz
	- Scripts that start GUIs now use VME-300 form factor by default (instead VME-230)
	- updated GUIs in order to remove some display bugs that became apparent when using caQtDm version 4.0.2

2.7.6 Fri 8 Jan 2015 11:00:00 CET:
	- Added flashing support for PCIe and cPCI form factors


2.7.4 Fri 11 Dec 2015 13:00:00 CET:
	- Bug fix, where scripts for GUIs did not accept -d switch
	- SFP alarm handling added to databases and GUIs. Removed printout of powerRx error to shell on each occurance of the error. 

2.7.3 Fri 4 Dec 2015 17:00:00 CET:
	- Updated documentation, readme files, examples, templates and substitution files
	    - macros EVR and EVG replaced with DEVICE
	    - GUIs updated. Also, they now accept SYS and DEVICE macros instead of EVR/EVG macro
	- added FLNK macro to evr-softEvent.template, added similar template (evr-softEvent-measure.template) with performance measurements for received events
	- Fixed the race condition present in PCIe form factors (interupt enabling)
	- Bug fix in data buffer ISR: DataRxCtrl_stop bust be set on each interrupt when dealing with 230 series HW (and/or firmware < 200)
	- Compiles under Windows system (tested on: GNU Make 4.1, Linker Version 12.00.21005.1, Compiler Version 18.00.21005.1 for x64)
	- Resolved a bug in SFP code, where uninitialized 'timer' could cause segmentation fault
	- Data buffer fixes: 
		- changed the way data buffer instance is fetched internally
		- SW overflow is detected only for segments someone is interested in (we don't care for the rest)
		- in order to avoid copying entire data buffer in 300 series, maximum length to copy is derived from segments all users are interested in. This will be further fixed with new HW fixes for the data buffer.
		- user update thread priority can be set by the user
    	- dataBufferUser class now directly exposes underlying Rx and Tx buffer. Prefered way of interfacing with the data buffer are still send() and get() functions.
    	- added userOffset, which enables the user to select where 0 offset will be in respect to the start of the data buffer
    	- minor bug fixes


2.7.2 Fri 20 Nov 2015 08:44:00 CET: 
	- Fixed gated pulsers. Issue was with missing instances of pulsers 28-31 => gate driving pulsers were never enabled
