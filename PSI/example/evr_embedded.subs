# Record set for an easy configuration of pulsers for trigger switching between normal and switched mode
#
# Important records:
# $(SYS)-$(DEVICE):TS$(ID)-Event-SP           -> Event number that triggers the pulsers
# $(SYS)-$(DEVICE):TS$(ID)-Pul-Norm-Width-SP  -> The width in [us] of the pulse to be outputted in normal mode
# $(SYS)-$(DEVICE):TS$(ID)-Pul-Norm-Delay-SP  -> The delay in [us] of the pulse to be outputted in normal mode
# $(SYS)-$(DEVICE):TS$(ID)-Pul-Sw-Width-SP    -> The width in [us] of the pulse to be outputted in switched mode
# $(SYS)-$(DEVICE):TS$(ID)-Pul-Sw-Delay-SP    -> The delay in [us] of the pulse to be outputted in switched mode
# $(SYS)-$(DEVICE):TS$(ID)-Sim-Sel            -> Normal mode or simulate switched mode. Useful for testing purposes.
# $(SYS)-$(DEVICE):TS$(ID)-Gate-Set-SP        -> Set event number that sets the pulser gate
# $(SYS)-$(DEVICE):TS$(ID)-Gate-Reset-SP      -> Set event number that resets the pulser gate
# 
# Mandatory macros:
#  SYS = System name
#  DEVICE = Event receiver / timing card name (same as mrmEvrSetupVME()) Eg. EVR0
#  
#  Event          = Event number that triggers the pulsers
#  Pul-Norm-Width = The width of the pulse to be outputted in normal mode
#  Pul-Norm-Delay = The delay of the pulse to be outputted in normal mode
#  Pul-Sw-Width   = The width of the pulse to be outputted in switched mode
#  Pul-Sw-Delay   = The delay of the pulse to be outputted in switched mode.
#  Output         = Name of the output where the pulse is routed. Eg. FrontUnivOut0, FrontUnivOut1,..., RearUniv0, RearUniv1, ...
#  
# Optional macros:
#  Pul-Norm-ID       = ID of the pulser used for normal mode. Default: Pulser 22
#  Pul-Sw-ID         = ID of the pulser used for switched mode. Default: Pulser 23
#  Gate-Pul-ID       = Pulser ID that represents the gate to use. Default: 28 = Pulser 28 -> Gate 0
#                      Gate = 28 : Pulser 28 -> Gate 0
#                      Gate = 29 : Pulser 29 -> Gate 1
#                      Gate = 30 : Pulser 30 -> Gate 2
#                      Gate = 31 : Pulser 31 -> Gate 3
#  Set-Evt   = Id of the event that gates pulser Pul-Sw-ID to the Output. Default: 6 = RF OFF beam event in SwissFEL
#  Reset-Evt = Id of the event that gates pulser Pul-Norm-ID to the Output. Default: 38 = Start of sequence event (SOS) in SwissFEL

## Control for mapping a pulse geneator to an event code in hardware.
## Each pulser-function combination can be mapped to multiple events.
## Available functions:
##		- Trig : causes a received event to trigger a pulser. A pulse based on pulser polarity, delay and width will be outputted.
##		- Set  : causes a received event to force a pulser into set state(based on pulser polarity).
##		- Reset: causes a received event to force a pulser into reset state(based on pulser polarity).
## Gated pulsers only have 'Set' and 'Reset' functions.
#
## Pulser polarity defines the pulser set and reset state:
##		- Active high: Output is logic high in set state and logic low in reset state
##		- Active low: Output is logic low in set state and logic high in reset state
#
# Macros:
#  SYS = system name (auto expanded by parent)
#  DEVICE = Event receiver / timing card name (same as mrmEvrSetupVME()) Eg. EVR0. (auto expanded by parent)
#  PID = Pulser ID #
#  F = Pulse generator function
#    Choices are: "Trig", "Set", "Reset"
#  EVT = Initial event code
#  ID = Mappings must have unique ID for each PID-F combination.
#    Only mappings with ID=0 are displayed in the GUI

## Mapping between hardware event code and a software (EPICS) database event
## In addition to firing an EPICS database event on each occurance of hardware event, a counter for the specific EVT is increased.
#
# Macros:
#  SYS = System name (auto expanded by parent)
#  DEVICE = Event receiver / timing card name (same as mrmEvrSetupVME()) Eg. EVR0. (auto expanded by parent)
#  EVT = Event code (hardware). Set EVT=0 to disable.
#  CODE = EPICS database event number (software)
#  FLNK = If provided, forward links to the record after all records from this template are processed
#

}
# If you want to enable measuring the jitter on received events comment out the previous substitution and use this one instead
# 
# Additinal macros:
#  HIST_LEN = number of histogram bins created from frequency measurements. Default 200.
#  HIST_ULIM = histogram upper limit. Default 12.
#  HIST_LLIM = histogram lower limit. Default 8.
# 
# NOTE: make sure your system supports the 'histogram' record before using this template!

# This templates stores pulse ID and event received/not received information in two waveforms.
# This way the user can inspect event arrival corelated to pulse IDs.
#
#
# Mandatory macros:
#  SYS = System name
#  DEVICE = Event receiver / timing card name (same as mrmEvrSetupVME()) Eg. EVR0
#  
#  EVT = event number we are interested in. Eg. 6 for RF OFF beam event
#
# Optional macros:
#  TRIGER_ACQUISITION = Timing event number, which is fired when we want to capture event status and pulse ID. 
#                       Usually this is near the end of the event sequence. Eg. BS read event. Default: 28
#  N_SAMPLES = Number of samples the buffer for event statuses and pulse IDs will hold. Default: 200
#  DISABLE = Disables (1) or enables (0) acquisition of event statuses and pulse IDs. Default 0 (enabled)
#  
# Important records:
#  $(SYS)-$(DEVICE):PTRN-$(EVT)-EVTBUF   -> A buffer with event statuses. 
#                                           Each entry corresponds to one acquisition triggered by $(SYS)-$(DEVICE):PTRN-$(EVT)-EVT-TRIG record.
#                                           Event arrival is signaled by $(SYS)-$(DEVICE):PTRN-$(EVT)-EVT-TRIG record.
#                                           Value 0 means event event EVT did not arrive in the time between last and this acquisition was triggered
#                                           Value 1 means event event EVT did arrive in the time between last and this acquisition was triggered
#  $(SYS)-$(DEVICE):PTRN-$(EVT)-PIDBUF   -> Stores the current Pulse ID each time acquisition is triggered. Entry in this record can be compared to 
#                                           entries in $(SYS)-$(DEVICE):PTRN-$(EVT)-EVTBUF to see if event did or did not arrive in this pulse ID.
#  $(SYS)-$(DEVICE):PTRN-$(EVT)-EVT-TRIG -> Processed when EVT event is received.
#  $(SYS)-$(DEVICE):PTRN-$(EVT)-TRIG     -> Processed when TRIGER_ACQUISITION event is received.
#  $(SYS)-$(DEVICE):PTRN-$(EVT)-DISABLE  -> see description for optional macro DISABLE.
